📌 Project Overview

The Placement Analytics Dashboard is an end-to-end data visualization solution designed to help education and training stakeholders track learner readiness, placement progress, and interview outcomes in real time.

The dashboard converts raw learner and placement data into actionable insights, enabling faster decision-making, improved candidate screening, and efficient placement planning.

Developed during my Data Science Internship, this project addresses real-world operational challenges faced by placement teams.

🎯 Business Problem

Placement teams often face:

Manual and time-consuming reporting

Limited visibility into learner readiness

Difficulty prioritizing candidates for interviews

Delays in interview scheduling and decisions

Goal:
Build a centralized dashboard that provides clear, real-time insights into learner performance and placement readiness.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard development & visualization

Excel / Google Sheets – Data cleaning & preprocessing

Power Query – ETL and data transformation

DAX – KPI calculations and measures

📈 Key Features

Learner Readiness Tracking
Visualizes learner status based on performance and eligibility criteria.

Placement Funnel Analysis
Tracks learners across stages: Applied → Shortlisted → Interviewed → Placed.

Batch-wise & Time-based Analysis
Compares placement performance across batches and months.

Interactive Filters & Drill-downs
Enables exploration by batch, date, and readiness level.
