📊 Placement Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

The Placement Analytics Dashboard is an end-to-end data visualization solution built to help education and training stakeholders track learner readiness, placement progress, and interview outcomes in real time.
The dashboard transforms raw learner and placement data into actionable insights that enable faster decision-making, improved candidate screening, and better placement planning.

This project was developed during my Data Science Internship and focuses on solving real-world operational challenges faced by placement teams.

🎯 Business Problem

Placement teams often struggle with:

Manual and time-consuming reporting

Lack of visibility into learner readiness

Difficulty prioritizing candidates for interviews

Delays in interview scheduling and decision-making

Goal:
Create a centralized dashboard that provides clear, real-time insights into learner performance and placement readiness.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard development & visualization

Excel / Google Sheets – Data cleaning & preprocessing

Power Query – ETL and data transformation

DAX – KPI calculations and measures
